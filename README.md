# Titanic
Implementation:
i. Import Titanic Dataset
ii. Data Cleaning: Use an appropriate method to handle missing value
iii. Feature engineering:
iv. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using, plot histogram, derive variance, Pearson
correlation coefficient matrix, Features density plots (indicating Central tendency and
spread) of every feature grouped by class label, Box Plot for every feature
v. Feature scaling
vi. Data Pre-processing: (1) Feature selection using Information Gain (IG) (2) Feature
extraction using Principle Component Analysis (PCA).
vii. Perform Classification task with and without feature selection using classifiers
(Bayes Classifiers, Logistic regression, K-nearest classifier). Do comparative study on
mentioned classifiers using evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score) in tabular
form.
